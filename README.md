## My process
After extracting the files and kept with the instructions, the HTML was like the skeleton where i started structuring my fundation.

The PC view was the first stage and i started arranging and styling the element as i moved on, making it look good and exactly the example i was to follow.

Now the mobile version gave me a littel bit a difficult time to make it really fit what i wanted the look should be. I finally completed the image positioning in the parent container and also aline the H1 and the paragrah section to fall in place with all my positioning.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
From the beginning, QR code is pictorial scan for a quick information about a particular item, so creating it is a good experience and i have learnt how to go about it.



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1 class="head">
          Improve your front-end skills by building projects.
        </h1>
```
```css
.container {
  width: 320px;
  height: 497px;
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 25px;
  padding: 15px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  box-shadow: 0 25px 25px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
}
```


### Continued development

I will like to keep developing my skills in diffrent areas and aspect of coding with frontend mentors
